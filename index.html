                                React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications
                                using React and the app platform's native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                                JavaScript to access your platform's APIs as well as to describe the appearance
                                and behavior of your UI using React components: <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</em>
                                You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let's cover how
                                components work in React Native.

                                React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user
                                interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
                                understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                            <p class="text"><strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                                examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                            <p class="text"><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                                elements inside JavaScript like so: <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.</p>
                            <p class="text">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more.
                                Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                                <span class="text__bg">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>.</p>
                            <p class="text"><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for "properties".</p>
                            <p class="text"><strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                                how components render, state is like a component's personal data storage. State is useful
                                for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                                State gives your components memory!</p>

                            <p class="text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                                <em>onChangeText</em> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text
                                changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when
                                the text is submitted.</p>
                            <p class="text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words
                                into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written
                                the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕".</p>
